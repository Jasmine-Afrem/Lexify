# Lexify - The Engaging Word Learning Game
---

Welcome to Lexify! An interactive Android word guessing game designed to make learning new vocabulary fun and engaging. Lexify challenges players to guess words based on clues, with a strong emphasis on understanding word meanings, synonyms, and usage contexts.

The game aims to gradually increase in difficulty, starting with a base of levels (e.g., 100 levels planned), where earlier levels might feature fewer words to guess (e.g., 4 words for the first 10 levels) and complexity increases over time.

## üéÆ How to Play

1.  **Start a Game:** Navigate to a level or start a new game from the home screen.

3.  **Guess the Word:** Type your guess using the on-screen keyboard.
4.  **Submit:** Press 'Submit' to check your answer.
    *   **Green:** Correct letter in the correct position.
    *   **Yellow:** Correct letter in the wrong position.

5.  **Use Hints:** If you're stuck, you can use up to 3 hints per word, which will reveal a letter in its correct position.
6.  **Give Up (Optional):** If you can't figure out a word, you can choose to give up and see the answer.
7.  **Learn:** After a word is revealed (either by guessing, hints, or giving up), you'll have the option to learn more about it ‚Äì its meaning, synonyms, and how it's used in different contexts.
8.  **Advance:** Complete all words in a level to move to the next.

*   **Definitions:** Clear explanations of what the word means.
*   **Synonyms:** Words with similar meanings.
*   **Contextual Examples:** How the word is used in sentences.

This approach aims to turn a fun game into a valuable learning tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Platform:** Android
*   **IDE:** Android Studio
*   **Language:** Java
*   **UI:** XML Layouts

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

*   Expanded word database and more levels.
*   More diverse clue types.
*   Advanced game settings and themes.
*   Leaderboards and social sharing.
*   Daily challenges.
*   Pronunciation guides for words.
